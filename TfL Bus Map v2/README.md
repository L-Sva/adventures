# TfL Bus Mapping v2 - using canvas

## Motivation
I've previously made a version of the TfL bus routes in London using svg elements, but even while compelting that project, I felt that the loading time was poor. Having become wiser in the ways of canvas, I now realise that svg quickly becomes unsuitable for a large number of elements drawn onto the screen and canvas is a more suitable option.

## Aim
To create a bus route on a map using canvas, with interactive elements.

#### Slow loading times
